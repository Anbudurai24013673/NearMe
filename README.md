    <h2 align="center">
       <p> 
    
                Thillai Nataraja Temple, also referred as the Chidambaram Nataraja Temple, is a Hindu temple dedicated
                to Nataraja, the form of Shiva as the lord of dance (cosmic dancer)
    
                This temple is located in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India. This temple has ancient roots and a Shiva
                shrine existed at the site when the town was known as Thillai.
         
                The temple architecture symbolizes the connection between the arts and spirituality, creative activity
                and the divine.
        
                The temple wall carvings display all the 108 karanas from the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni, and these
                postures form a foundation of Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance.
         
                It is the only Shiva temple common to both the Pancha Sabha Thalam and the Pancha Bhuta Thalam.
